OpenMM Neural Network Plugin
============================

This is a plugin for [OpenMM](http://openmm.org) that allows neural networks
to be used for defining forces.  It is implemented with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
To use it, you create a PyTorch model that takes particle positions as input
and produces energy as output.  This plugin uses the model to apply
forces to particles during a simulation.

Installation
============

At present this plugin must be compiled from source.  It uses CMake as its build
system.  Before compiling you must install LibTorch, which is the PyTorch C++ API,
by following the instructions at https://pytorch.org.  You can then
follow these steps.

1. Create a directory in which to build the plugin.

2. Run the CMake GUI or ccmake, specifying your new directory as the build directory and the top
level directory of this project as the source directory. Remember to add 
`-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0` flag to use old ABI so as to stay compatible
with other component (at least for all prebuilt openmms for Python 3.6/7.x).

3. Press "Configure".  (Do not worry if it produces an error message about not being able to find PyTorch.)

4. Set OPENMM_DIR to point to the directory where OpenMM is installed.  This is needed to locate
the OpenMM header files and libraries.

5. Set PYTORCH_DIR to point to the directory where you installed the LibTorch (Remember to download
the version with correct ABI!).

6. Set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to the directory where the plugin should be installed.  Usually,
this will be the same as OPENMM_DIR, so the plugin will be added to your OpenMM installation.

7. If you plan to build the OpenCL platform, make sure that OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIR and
OPENCL_LIBRARY are set correctly, and that NN_BUILD_OPENCL_LIB is selected.

8. If you plan to build the CUDA platform, make sure that CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR is set correctly
and that NN_BUILD_CUDA_LIB is selected.

9. Press "Configure" again if necessary, then press "Generate".

10. Use the build system you selected to build and install the plugin.  For example, if you
selected Unix Makefiles, type `make install` to install the plugin, and `make PythonInstall` to
install the Python wrapper.

Usage
=====

Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for cudnn and libtorch when necessary.

The first step is to create a PyTorch model defining the calculation to
perform.  It should take particle positions (in the form of an Nx3 Tensor) as
its input, and return the potential energy as its output.  The model must then be
converted to a TorchScript module and saved to a file.  Converting to TorchScript
can usually be done with a single call to `torch.jit.script()` or `torch.jit.trace()`,
although more complicated models can sometimes require extra steps.  See the
[PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html)
for details.  Here is an example of Python code that does this for a very
simple calculation (a harmonic force attracting every particle to the origin).

```python
import torch

class ForceModule(torch.nn.Module):
    def forward(self, positions):
        return torch.sum(positions**2)

module = torch.jit.script(ForceModule())
module.save('model.pt')
```

To use the model in a simulation, create a `TorchForce` object and add
it to your `System`.  The constructor takes the path to the saved model as an
argument.  For example,

```python
from openmmtorch import *
f = TorchForce('model.pt')
system.addForce(f)
```

When defining the model to perform a calculation, you may want to apply
periodic boundary conditions.  To do this, call `setUsesPeriodicBoundaryConditions(True)`
on the `TorchForce`.  The graph is then expected to take a second input,
which contains the current periodic box vectors.  You
can make use of them in whatever way you want for computing the force.  For
example, the following code applies periodic boundary conditions to each
particle position to translate all of them into a single periodic cell.

```python
class ForceModule(torch.nn.Module):
    def forward(self, positions, boxvectors):
        boxsize = boxvectors.diag()
        periodicPositions = positions - torch.floor(positions/boxsize)*boxsize
        return torch.sum(periodicPositions**2)
```

Note that this code assumes a rectangular box.  Applying periodic boundary
conditions with a triclinic box requires a slightly more complicated
calculation.
